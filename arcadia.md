Arcadia is the integration of the [Clojure programming language](http://clojure.org/) into the [Unity3D game engine](http://unity3d.com/). It brings a high performance, live coded, functional Lisp programming experience to the industry standard and widely adopted engine. Arcadia is written in Clojure, C#, Ruby and C and developed in collaboration with [Tims Gardner](http://timsgardner.com/).
