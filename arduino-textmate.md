The Arduino-TextMate bundle is a bundle for [TextMate][2] that allows you to code and upload Arduino projects entirely from within TextMate. It was produced in response to the limitations of the Arduino text editor.

Current features include syntax highlighting, code completion, snippets, compiling/uploading, inline help and simple serial port monitoring. Planned features include better support for multiple files, better serial port monitoring, better device selection, and better error reporting, among others.
