[Boards](http://nasser.github.io/boards/) is a minimal infinite digital whiteboard designed for my teaching practice. It is optimized for portable pen tablets, and features writing, panning, zooming, infinite undo, passive saving to local storage, and full history streaming to GitHub Gists. Boards was written in JavaScript and first used at the [School For Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io/).
