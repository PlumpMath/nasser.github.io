Don't Wake The Bear is a multiplayer game played on a single PlayStation Vita. A bear is asleep on the device, and players pass it around, careful not to jostle it too much or risk waking it up. Players can also add items to the cave, like alarm clocks or tranquilizers, to keep it asleep on their turn and try and cause it to wake up on another player's turn. The game was built in C# for the PlayStation Mobile platform. It was a collaboration with [Kaho Abe][2] and [Francis Hsueh aka Policy][3].

Don't Wake The Bear was developed as part of the invitational game jam at [IndieCade East 2013][5] at [the Museum of the Moving Image][6].
