[everyunicode](https://twitter.com/everyunicode) is a bot tweeting the entire set of Unicode characters one at a time, every thirty minutes. It will take many years to complete its task. It is an exploration into the enormity of human writing and the complexity of what is often dismissed as "plain text." everyunicode was inspired by [everyword](https://twitter.com/everyword) and was written in Ruby.
