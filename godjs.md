[God.js](https://github.com/nasser/god.js) is a programming language exploring relegious scripture as instruction. By treating holy text as source code to be written by humans and enforced by machines, God.js questions the nature of the divine, the authority of religious interpretation, and the role coding plays in an increasingly tech-dependent society.

God.js was developed in collaboration with [Ivan Safrin](http://www.ivansafrin.com/) and [Will Brand](https://twitter.com/wrbrand) in JavaScript during [Art Hack Day 2013](http://www.arthackday.net/events/god-mode) at [319 Scholes](http://319scholes.org/).
