The [Jean-Claude Van Jam](http://jeanclaudevanjam.com/) was a 48 hour game jam themed around the filmography of Jean-Claude Van Damme. It was held at Eyebeam and organized by myself, [Ida Benedetto](http://uncommonplaces.com/), [Kaho Abe](http://kahoabe.net/), [Ben Johnson](https://twitter.com/GameDesignerBen), and [Matt Parker](http://madparker.com/).

At the start of the jam, nine teams each picked a flash drive loaded with a Van Damme movie out of fish bowl. That movie became the constraint they designed their game around over the next 48 hours.
