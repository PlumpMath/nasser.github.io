Killingspree is a video game art piece about violence in video games. The game is a clone of Wolfenstein 3D that uses pictures of fellow gallery goers as the faces of the enemies you kill. It was commissioned for the [Terraforms show at Babycastles](http://showpapergallery.org/post/2823373195/terraforms-game-mods-at-babycastles-last-exhibit) and completed (in 18 hours) as a collaboration with [Zach Gage](http://stfj.net/), who has a more thorough [writeup](http://stfj.net/index2.php?project=art/2011/Killing%20Spree) on his site. Killingspree was coded in [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) and [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/).
