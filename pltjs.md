[`plt.js`](https://github.com/nasser/pltjs) is an example-driven rapid programming language prototyping and teaching tool. It uses a loose HTML syntax to specify code examples in new languages as well as the [PEG grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) of those languages. `plt.js` is written in JavaScript and based on [PEG.js](http://pegjs.org/).  It has been used in programming language design classes at [ITP](http://tisch.nyu.edu/itp) and [SFPC](http://sfpc.io/).
