Robots In The Sky is a two-player shooter game built on eye tracking hardware. Players take on the role of a defensive mech and deflect evil flying robots by looking them, causing the mech's laser eyes to fire and shoot them out of the sky. The eyes of each player are tracked using [Tobii](http://www.tobii.com/) hardware and fed into the game as the sole input. The game was comissioned by [Not Impossible](http://notimpossible.com/) and installed at the [Barbican Digital Revolution](http://www.barbican.org.uk/digital-revolution) show. Robots In The Sky was developed in collaboration with [Kaho Abe](http://kahoabe.net) and built in [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/) using C#.
