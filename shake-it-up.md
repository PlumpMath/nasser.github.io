Shake It Up! is a digital/physical two player timing game. One player shakes up a can of soda and then sets it back on the table. Both players then race to be the first to pick the can back up, but acting too soon results in the can exploding. The can is wired to an Adafruit Flora and used as a capacative switch, meaning that the actual shaking has no effect on the game and is purely performative. Shake It Up! was developed in collaboration with [Kaho Abe](http://kahoabe.net/) and built in Unity and Arduino.

Due to the simple nature of the technology, impromptu variants are easy to make. Pole Licker was prototyped in a play ground in Witten Germany after a few drinks.
