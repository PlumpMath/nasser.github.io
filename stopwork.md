[Stopwork](http://github.com/nasser/stopwork) is a minimal HTML5 slideshow framework. Slides are written in a text file where each line is a slide. Different types of slides such as images, videos, or embedded webpages are inferred from the content of the slide. Stopwork is written in Ruby and JavaScript.

Internal presentations at [Eyebeam](http://eyebeam.org) are known as Stopworks, because everyone is expected to stop working and provide feedback to one another. This framework was originally built to support my own Stopwork presentations and takes its name from them.
